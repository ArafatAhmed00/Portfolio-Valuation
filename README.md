Risk-Return Analysis of Selected Mutual Funds and Portfolios Compared to Market
Overview

This project, completed for FIN 637 - Investment Theory, analyzing the risk-return properties of selected mutual funds and portfolios relative to the market index (DSEX). The study involves creating and evaluating portfolios with stocks from diverse industries, assessing their performance through key financial metrics, and making informed recommendations for investors.
Objectives

    Portfolio Analysis:
        Construct portfolios with 20 stocks selected from different sectors and evaluate their risk-return characteristics.
        Develop equally and value-weighted portfolios for analysis.

    Mutual Fund Analysis:
        Analyze the performance of three mutual funds based on historical data.
        Evaluate their returns, volatility, and Sharpe ratios.

    Market Comparison:
        Compare the constructed portfolios and mutual funds to the market index (DSEX) to evaluate relative performance.

    Investment Recommendations:
        Provide actionable insights and recommendations for different types of investors based on the findings.

Comparative Insights

    Prime Finance First Mutual Fund offers the highest mean return but with significant risk, making it suitable for aggressive investors.
    The DSEX Index has the lowest risk but also the lowest return, making it ideal for conservative investors.
    The Value-Weighted Portfolio demonstrates the lowest standard deviation among the constructed portfolios, indicating lower risk.

Methodology

    Data Collection:
        Historical data for 60 months (April 2016 - March 2021) was obtained from Thomson Reuters Eikon.
        Additional data was collected from the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) and other sources.

    Portfolio Construction:
        Stocks were selected from 20 diverse industries for better diversification.
        Portfolios were created with equal and value-weighted methodologies.

    Risk and Return Metrics:
        Calculated metrics include average return, standard deviation, variance, Sharpe ratio, skewness, kurtosis, and beta.

    Statistical Analysis:
        Regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between portfolio returns and market returns.
        ANOVA was used to decompose variance into systematic and firm-specific components.

Tools and Techniques

    Microsoft Excel: For calculations, data visualization, and regression analysis.
    Statistical Methods:
        Sharpe Ratio: Evaluates risk-adjusted returns.
        Skewness and Kurtosis: Assesses distribution properties.
        Regression Analysis: Measures portfolio sensitivity to market movements.

Deliverables

    Report:
        Detailed findings, methodology, and recommendations.
        Includes comparative analysis of portfolios and mutual funds.

    Dataset:
        Historical returns for 20 selected stocks and mutual funds.

    Calculations:
        Excel file containing risk-return metrics, regression analysis, and graphical visualizations.

Recommendations

    Conservative Investors:
        Consider market index (DSEX) or low-risk portfolios like the value-weighted portfolio of 20 stocks.

    Aggressive Investors:
        Prime Finance First Mutual Fund offers higher returns with greater risk and volatility.

    Balanced Approach:
        Combine low-risk and high-risk portfolios to achieve diversification.
